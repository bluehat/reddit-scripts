# reddit-scripts
Some scripts we are using to understand behavior on reddit.

Ok, how you can help.

1. Clone the repo locally
1. Run threads.py until you get kicked off by rate limiting
1. Delete the subreddits from unscrapedsubreddits.csv that you got through
1. Delete data from threads.csv that belong to a subreddit you didn't finish scanning
1. Submit the changes that your threads.csv file made 
1. Feel awesome contributing to science

You are totally encouraged to start at a totally random place. You can set that by re-ordering unscraopedsubreddits.csv

Apologies for the confusion, yes this is Python 3. Got to learn the libraries some time, right?
